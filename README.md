# Features of the Game
The game is basically one of precision and accuracy. The main goal of the game is to stack blocks one on top of the other without making many mistakes and also prevent the tower fro collapsing. Upon detection of the spacebar being pressed down, the swinging rope+hook lets go of a block and the block falls vertically. The player must hit the space bar at the right time for the block to fall on the previos tower blocks.

We have also implemented a rudimentary form of scrolling , which enables the player to play infinitely.

We also have a scoreboard that increments by 1 everytime a block lands successfully on the previous tower of blocks.

Each player has 3 lives. That is if the player makes the swinging block to fall at the wrong time , he/she loses 1 life. 

# Instructions to run the game
